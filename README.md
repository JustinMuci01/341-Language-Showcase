# 341-Language-Showcase
Bash language showcase as part of CS-341, Programming Language Design and Implementation, at UIC. I ran the scripts in this order using Ubuntu running the Bash shell. 

make_directory.sh - This script creates a new folder in the current working directory called TEST_FILES. Within that folder, six files will also be made. Three of those files will be text files, and the other three will be .c files.

print_files.sh - This script will print the contents of all files within the TEST_FILES folder.

organize.sh - This script will organize the text and c files into respective folders within the TEST_FILES folder.

The slides folder will have a pdf of the slides I used during the video presentation.
